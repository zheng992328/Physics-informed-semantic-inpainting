# Physics-informed semantic inpainting
 
A fundamental problem in geostatistical modeling is to infer the heterogeneous geological field based on limited measurements and some prior spatial statistics. Semantic inpainting, a technique for image processing using deep generative models, has been recently applied for this purpose, demonstrating its effectiveness in dealing with complex spatial patterns. However, the original semantic inpainting framework  incorporates only information from direct measurements, while in geostatistics indirect measurements are often plentiful. To overcome this limitation, here we propose a physics-informed semantic inpainting framework, employing the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) and jointly incorporating the direct and indirect measurements by exploiting the underlying physical laws. Our simulation results for a high-dimensional problem with 512 dimensions show that in the new method, the physical conservation laws are satisfied and contribute in enhancing the inpainting performance compared to using only the direct measurements.
